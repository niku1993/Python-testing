After that I joined as a manual tester in AT&T project central team, which was a big team. I worked approx 2 years in central team and after that I joined east team, which is comparatively smaller team and as of now I am working in east team.
I have approx 7 years of experience in the organization out of which first 4 years I was working as a quality analyst in google project, where I check the users account credentials and block the suspected hijack based on certain criteria.
I also attend all the review meetings such as backlog refinement meeting, test planning, test case development meeting and scrum meeting.
In this project my work is to test the AT&T east team site and all other testing activities such as prepare test cases, test execution, finding defects and reporting bugs to dev team.
I am working in Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd. as a Manual tester in AT&T project.
My name is Nitish Kataria
